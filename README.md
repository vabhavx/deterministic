- Why your builds lie to you
+ Why your builds *can't lie* anymore

## Why This Matters to Everyone (Not Just Engineers)

When the 2023 XZ backdoor attack compromised Linux systems worldwide, it revealed a terrifying truth: **we've been trusting lies in our build systems**. 

This project isn't just about code - it's about **rebuilding trust in the digital foundation of our society**. 

✅ **For Developers**: Prevents "works on my machine" disasters  
✅ **For Hospitals**: Ensures medical software builds identically worldwide  
✅ **For You**: Why should you care? Because the next supply chain attack could be in your car's software or your bank's systems.

> This isn't a tool. It's a **mathematical guarantee**.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Rust 1.75+ with `cargo` 
- Kani formal verification tool
- Docker (optional, for containerized builds)

### Quick Start
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/vabhavx/deterministic.git
cd deterministic

# Install Kani for formal verification
cargo install --locked kani-verifier
cargo kani setup

# Run validation suite
./validate_builds.sh

# Build with deterministic guarantees
cargo build --release
```

### Verify Installation
```bash
# Run formal verification proofs
cargo kani --harness test_deterministic_build

# Check build reproducibility
cargoing build --release && cargo build --release
sha256sum target/release/deterministic # Should be identical across runs
```

## Usage

### Basic Build Verification
```bash
# Verify a single package
./validate_builds.sh --package my-crate

# Cross-platform verification
./validate_builds.sh --platforms linux,macos,windows

# Generate formal proof
cargo kani --harness verify_build_determinism
```

### CI/CD Integration
```yaml
# .github/workflows/deterministic.yml
name: Deterministic Build Verification
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  verify:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Setup Rust
        uses: dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable
      - name: Install Kani
        run: cargo install --locked kani-verifier
      - name: Run Verification
        run: ./validate_builds.sh --ci
```

❌ KANI FORMAL VERIFICATION REPORT
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

🚨 PROOF STATUS: FAILED
📍 Issue Detected: Non-deterministic timestamp inclusion
🔍 Location: src/build.rs:142
❗ Problem: System time affects build output

🛠️  Suggested Fix:
   Remove or normalize timestamp generation
   Use SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH for reproducible builds
   
📊 Analysis:
   ✓ Memory safety: VERIFIED
   ✓ No undefined behavior: VERIFIED  
   ❌ Build determinism: FAILED
