## Welcome to the Trust Revolution!

Welcome, future contributor! You're about to join something bigger than code – you're joining a revolution that's rebuilding trust in the digital world. Every line of code you contribute helps protect millions of people from supply chain attacks and build inconsistencies.

## 🏆 Prestige Contributor Pledge

*By contributing to this project, I pledge to:*

- **🔒 Never Compromise on Security**: Every contribution maintains our mathematical guarantees
- **📚 Document Everything**: Clear documentation ensures accessibility for all skill levels
- **🧪 Test Relentlessly**: Formal verification requires rigorous testing protocols
- **🤝 Welcome Everyone**: Foster an inclusive environment where all contributors thrive
- **🌍 Think Global Impact**: Remember that our work protects critical infrastructure worldwide
- **⚡ Move Fast, Break Nothing**: Speed with safety through deterministic processes

*"When we prove our software is correct, we're not just writing code – we're building the foundation for a more trustworthy digital world."*

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Rust** (latest stable version)
- **Kani** (for formal verification)
- **Git** (for version control)
- **A passion for building trustworthy software!**

### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/vabhavx/deterministic.git
cd deterministic

# Install dependencies
cargo build

# Run the verification suite
cargo test
kani verify-all

# You're ready to contribute!
```

## 📋 How to Contribute

### 1. 🔍 Find Your Mission

Choose your adventure:
- 🐛 **Bug Hunters**: Find and fix issues in our verification algorithms
- 🏗️ **Architects**: Design new formal verification methods
- 📖 **Educators**: Improve documentation and accessibility
- 🧪 **Scientists**: Add test cases and benchmarks
- 🎨 **UX Champions**: Make complex security concepts understandable

### 2. 🌿 Create Your Branch

```bash
# Use descriptive branch names
git checkout -b feature/merkle-tree-optimization
git checkout -b fix/verification-edge-case
git checkout -b docs/contributor-onboarding
```

### 3. 🔬 Development Process

#### For Code Changes:

1. **Write the test first** (TDD for trustworthy code)
2. **Implement your solution**
3. **Add formal verification proofs** (using Kani)
4. **Update documentation**
5. **Run the full test suite**

#### Example Contribution Workflow:

```rust
// 1. Add a failing test
#[test]
fn test_new_verification_feature() {
    // Test your new feature
    assert!(verify_deterministic_build(&input));
}

// 2. Implement the feature
pub fn verify_deterministic_build(input: &Input) -> bool {
    // Your implementation here
}

// 3. Add Kani proofs
#[kani::proof]
fn verify_deterministic_build_proof() {
    let input: Input = kani::any();
    let result = verify_deterministic_build(&input);
    // Mathematical guarantees here
}
```

### 4. 📝 Documentation Standards

- **Every function needs documentation**
- **Include examples in your docs**
- **Explain the *why*, not just the *what***
- **Use clear, jargon-free language**
- **Add diagrams for complex concepts**

Example:

```rust
/// Verifies the deterministic property of a build artifact.
///
/// This function mathematically proves that a build will produce
/// identical outputs given identical inputs, preventing supply chain
/// attacks and "works on my machine" issues.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```rust
/// let artifact = BuildArtifact::from_source("main.rs");
/// assert!(verify_deterministic(&artifact));
/// ```
///
/// # Security Guarantees
///
/// - **Cryptographic integrity**: SHA-256 hashing of all inputs
/// - **Formal verification**: Mathematical proof of correctness
/// - **Reproducible builds**: Bit-for-bit identical outputs
pub fn verify_deterministic(artifact: &BuildArtifact) -> bool {
    // Implementation here
}
```
